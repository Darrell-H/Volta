## What's in Store for Volta Engine?

Volta will have plenty of features that you would expect from a AAA game engine. The following are the main features I want implemented into Volta. ***Features are in no particular order.***

### Committed features coming to Volta:

  * Platform independence (Volta will support Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)
  * Multiple rendering API support (OpenGL is first)
  * Physically based rendering
  * Advanced 2D rendering
  * Featureful scene editor for 3D and 2D
  * Physics engine for 3D and 2D
  * Scripting system (Native scripting with C++ will be supported)
  * Artificial Intelligence
  * Animation (texture, skeletal, vertex, etc.)
  * Audio
  * Online multiplayer/networking

## Why Make a Game Engine?

The answer to that is to learn. If my only intention was to make a game, I would just launch Unity or Unreal and just make some games. I'm interested in creating a framework for programmers and artists to make high fidelity real time applications. I feel that building a game engine from scratch will also make me a stronger software engineer overall. Volta is my passion project and I can't wait to see where it goes.
